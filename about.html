            <h1>About Garvit</h1>
            <h2>Data-Driven, User-Centric, Problem Solver</h2>
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            
            <div class="subtitle">
            
                <p>My professional journey began with an inspiring discovery‚ÄîIndia‚Äôs thriving startup ecosystem through Startup India, which ignited my enthusiasm for working with early and mid-stage startups. This curiosity shaped my career aspiration to contribute meaningfully to impactful products.</p>
                
                <p>After graduating, I embarked on a career in <span class="highlight">Product Growth Development,</span> where I cultivated a passion for user experience, design, technology, analytics, and growth strategies. It was during this time that I found my calling in Product Management.</p>
                
                <p>In pursuit of further growth, I took a brief <u><i>career break to prepare for MBA exams,</i></u> aspiring to join a top-tier business school. Although the journey didn‚Äôt pan out as planned, it became a turning point. Instead of settling for less, I pivoted toward my plan B: doubling down on my passion for Product Management. During this period, I enrolled in specialized PM courses, attended industry events, and connected with professionals to enhance my skills and broaden my perspective.</p>
                
                <p>Shortly after, I secured an Associate Product Manager role at a B2B SaaS startup, which was a milestone in my professional journey. Alongside this, I completed the <span class="highlight">NextLeap Product Manager Fellowship,</span> an enriching experience that provided practical insights into PM fundamentals taught by industry experts.</p>
                
                <p>I later had the opportunity to work as a freelance and founding Product Manager at a stealth startup, where I <b>navigated unique challenges and applied my skills to create value.</b> These experiences reinforced my passion for tackling interesting problems that have the potential for widespread impact. To put it simply, my goal as a Product Manager is to help people work smarter, not harder.</p>
                
                <p>When I‚Äôm not immersed in tech and product challenges, you can find me indulging in my diverse interests‚Äîreading <i>(fantasy fiction and self-help),</i> staying active through yoga and gym sessions, traveling, or experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
            
            </div>
            <div class="subtitles">
                <h4>Noteworthy Skills</h4>
                <p>I‚Äôm a Product Manager who thrives at the intersection of creativity and strategy. From crafting <span class="highlight">Product Roadmaps</span> that inspire teams to writing <span class="highlight">crystal-clear PRDs</span> that align stakeholders, I‚Äôve honed the art of <i><u>turning ideas into actionable outcomes.</u></i> My expertise spans <b>User Research, Feature Prioritization,</b> and leveraging <span class="highlight">Agile/Scrum methodologies</span> to deliver exceptional products. Whether it‚Äôs defining <span class="highlight">Go-To-Market Strategies,</span> conducting <b>A/B Testing,</b> or diving deep into <b>Metrics Analysis,</b> I‚Äôm driven by a passion for continuous improvement and data-backed decision-making.</p>
                <p>Equipped with tools and technologies, including <b>JIRA, Figma, Whimsical, and Google Docs/Sheets,</b> I can turn complex ideas into wireframes and workflows that <i><u>engineers and designers love.</u></i> I have a solid foundation in <span class="highlight">SQL, Data Analysis,</span> APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to back decisions with numbers while easily navigating SaaS environments.</p>
                <p>But what sets me apart is my ability to collaborate across teams‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs aligning diverse stakeholders, leading cross-functional teams, or simply navigating the occasional meeting chaos with grace. With strong <b>Problem-Solving, Adaptability, and Market Research</b> skills, I ensure that every product meets the sweet spot of user needs, market demands, and business goals.</p>
                <p>Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm here to connect the dots, solve the puzzles, and deliver results‚Äîone roadmap at a time.</p>
